### **Procedure**

#### **1. Cell Harvesting**

**Option A: Gravity Settling**
1. **Transfer Cultures:**
   - Use the OT-2 to transfer 200 µL of yeast culture from the source plate to a new 96-well deep-well plate.
2. **Settle Cells:**
   - Allow the plate to sit undisturbed on the OT-2 deck for **60 minutes** to let cells settle by gravity.
3. **Remove Supernatant:**
   - Carefully aspirate **140 µL** of the supernatant from each well using the OT-2, leaving approximately 60 µL to avoid disturbing the cells.
   - Use slow aspiration speeds and aspirate from just below the liquid surface.

**Option B: Low-Speed Centrifugation (Preferred if available)**
1. **Transfer Cultures:**
   - Manually or using the OT-2, transfer 200 µL of yeast culture to each well of a 96-well deep-well plate.
2. **Centrifuge:**
   - Centrifuge the plate at **1,000 × g for 5 minutes** to pellet the cells.
3. **Remove Supernatant:**
   - Use the OT-2 to carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.

#### **2. Cell Wall Digestion**

1. **Add Zymolyase:**
   - Use the OT-2 to add **50 µL** of Zymolyase solution to each well.
2. **Mix Gently:**
   - Gently mix by slowly aspirating and dispensing **twice** with wide-bore tips.
3. **Incubate:**
   - Place the plate on the temperature module set to **30°C**.
   - Incubate for **45 minutes** to digest the cell walls.

#### **3. Cell Lysis**

1. **Add Lysis Buffer:**
   - Add **200 µL** of lysis buffer to each well using the OT-2.
2. **Mix Gently:**
   - Slowly pipette up and down **twice** to mix.
3. **Incubate:**
   - Let the plate stand at **room temperature** for **15 minutes** to ensure complete lysis.

#### **4. Protein Precipitation**

1. **Add Saturated NaCl:**
   - Add **100 µL** of saturated NaCl solution to each well using the OT-2.
2. **Mix Gently:**
   - Gently mix by pipetting up and down **twice**.
3. **Incubate:**
   - Allow the plate to sit at **room temperature** for **30 minutes** to precipitate proteins.

#### **5. DNA Precipitation**

1. **Transfer Supernatant:**
   - Carefully transfer **400 µL** of the clear supernatant to a new 96-well deep-well plate on the temperature module set to **4°C**.
   - Avoid transferring any precipitated proteins.
2. **Add Cold Ethanol:**
   - Add **800 µL** of pre-chilled 95–100% ethanol to each well using the OT-2.
3. **Mix Gently:**
   - Slowly pipette up and down **once** to mix.
4. **Incubate:**
   - Seal the plate and incubate at **-20°C** for **60 minutes** to precipitate DNA.

#### **6. DNA Washing**

1. **Remove Supernatant:**
   - Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant without disturbing the DNA pellet.
   - Use slow aspiration speeds and position the tip away from the pellet.
2. **Add 70% Ethanol:**
   - Add **500 µL** of cold 70% ethanol to each well using the OT-2.
3. **Incubate:**
   - Incubate at **-20°C** for **5 minutes**.
4. **Remove Ethanol:**
   - Carefully remove the ethanol without disturbing the pellet.

#### **7. DNA Drying**

1. **Air-Dry Pellets:**
   - Allow the DNA pellets to air-dry at **room temperature** for **15–30 minutes** until all residual ethanol has evaporated.

#### **8. DNA Resuspension**

1. **Add TE Buffer:**
   - Add **100 µL** of TE buffer or nuclease-free water to each well using the OT-2.
2. **Dissolve DNA:**
   - Incubate at **room temperature** for **1–2 hours** to allow DNA to dissolve passively.
   - For very high-molecular-weight DNA, consider incubating **overnight** without agitation.
3. **Optional Gentle Mixing:**
   - If necessary, gently mix by slowly aspirating and dispensing **50 µL** once with wide-bore tips.

#### **9. DNA Quality Assessment**

1. **Quantify DNA:**
   - Take a **5 µL** aliquot from each well for DNA quantification using spectrophotometry or fluorometry.
2. **Assess Integrity:**
   - Evaluate DNA integrity by running samples on an agarose gel or using capillary electrophoresis.

#### **10. Storage**

1. **Store DNA:**
   - Once fully dissolved and assessed, store the DNA samples at **-20°C** for long-term preservation.

### **Notes and Recommendations**

- **Gentle Handling:**
  - Use wide-bore pipette tips to reduce shear stress on DNA.
  - Set the OT-2 pipetting speeds to low settings for both aspiration and dispensing.
  - Avoid vortexing or vigorous mixing at all stages.

- **Pipetting Parameters:**
  - **Aspirate** slowly from just below the liquid surface to avoid disturbing pellets.
  - **Dispense** gently against the well wall to minimize bubbles and shear forces.

- **Enzyme Optimization:**
  - Adjust Zymolyase concentration and incubation time based on the specific yeast strain.
  - Some strains may require higher concentrations or longer incubation for effective cell wall digestion.

- **Temperature Control:**
  - Ensure the temperature module reaches and maintains the desired temperatures.
  - Pre-chill plates and reagents when necessary to enhance precipitation efficiency.

- **Ethanol Handling:**
  - Perform ethanol steps in a fume hood or well-ventilated area to avoid inhalation risks.
  - Keep ethanol containers closed when not in use to prevent evaporation.

- **Cross-Contamination Prevention:**
  - Use filter tips throughout the protocol to prevent cross-contamination.
  - Program the OT-2 to change tips between different reagents and samples.

- **Safety Precautions:**
  - Wear appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
  - Handle all reagents according to their safety data sheets (SDS).

- **Pilot Testing:**
  - Conduct a pilot run with a few samples to optimize the protocol parameters for your specific conditions and yeast strains.

- **Alternative Methods:**
  - Consider magnetic bead-based DNA purification kits compatible with automation for improved consistency and scalability.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Data Recording:**
  - Keep detailed records of reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any deviations from the protocol.

- **Quality Control:**
  - Include control samples to monitor the efficiency of cell lysis and DNA extraction.

- **Protocol Customization:**
  - Adjust volumes and incubation times as needed based on initial results and specific laboratory conditions.

### **Conclusion**

This optimized protocol for the OT-2 liquid handling robot enhances the extraction of high-molecular-weight DNA from yeast cultures by emphasizing gentle handling, precise temperature control, and careful pipetting techniques. Incorporating these considerations will help preserve DNA integrity and yield, making the samples suitable for sensitive downstream applications such as long-read sequencing.
