## OT-2 HMW DNA Extraction from Yeast Cultures (96-well format)

### Materials:
- OT-2 liquid handling robot with temperature module
- 96-well plate with yeast cultures
- 96-well deep-well plates (2 mL capacity)
- Zymolyase solution (5 units/µL in 1M sorbitol)
- Lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8.0)
- Saturated NaCl solution (6M)
- Cold 95-100% Ethanol (pre-chilled to 4°C)
- 70% Ethanol (pre-chilled to 4°C)
- TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0)

### Procedure:

1. Cell Harvesting:
   - Transfer 200 µL of yeast culture to a new deep-well plate using OT-2.
   - Allow cells to settle by gravity for 30 minutes on the OT-2 deck.
   - Carefully remove 150 µL of supernatant using OT-2.

2. Cell Wall Digestion:
   - Add 50 µL of Zymolyase solution using OT-2.
   - Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.

3. Cell Lysis:
   - Add 200 µL of lysis buffer using OT-2.
   - Allow to stand for 15 minutes for gentle lysis.

4. Protein Precipitation:
   - Add 100 µL of saturated NaCl solution using OT-2.
   - Allow to stand for 30 minutes for protein precipitation.

5. DNA Precipitation:
   - Carefully transfer 250 µL of supernatant to a new well on the temperature module using OT-2.
   - Set temperature module to 4°C.
   - Add 500 µL of cold 95-100% ethanol using OT-2.
   - Incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes for DNA precipitation.

6. DNA Washing:
   - Carefully remove 700 µL of supernatant using OT-2, leaving DNA pellet undisturbed.
   - Add 500 µL of pre-chilled 70% ethanol using OT-2.
   - Incubate at 4°C for 5 minutes.
   - Remove 450 µL of ethanol using OT-2.

7. DNA Resuspension:
   - Move plate to room temperature and allow remaining ethanol to evaporate for 10 minutes.
   - Add 100 µL of TE buffer using OT-2.
   - Allow DNA to dissolve passively at room temperature for several hours or overnight.

8. Final Mix and Storage:
   - If necessary, gently mix by slowly aspirating and dispensing 50 µL once using OT-2.
   - After ensuring complete dissolution, quantify DNA, assess quality, or store at -20°C for long-term preservation.

### Notes:
- This protocol is optimized for extracting HMW DNA from yeast using an OT-2 in a standard, well-ventilated laboratory.
- Gravity settling and careful supernatant removal are used to minimize DNA shearing.
- Avoid vortexing or vigorous mixing to preserve HMW DNA integrity.
- The temperature module maintains 4°C during critical steps to enhance DNA precipitation and quality.
- Passive dissolution at room temperature is crucial for complete dissolution of HMW DNA and to minimize shearing.
- Adjust incubation times and enzyme concentrations based on your specific yeast strain if needed.
- For very high molecular weight DNA, consider extending wait times and minimizing mixing steps.
- Ensure proper ventilation and wear appropriate PPE when handling ethanol.
- Complete dissolution before freezing for storage is important to prevent issues with incomplete dissolution or DNA degradation.

This protocol maintains a gentle approach for HMW DNA extraction while incorporating temperature control and emphasizing critical steps for DNA quality preservation.
