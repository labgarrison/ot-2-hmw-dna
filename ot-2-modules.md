Based on the protocol and the available modules for the OT-2, you can effectively perform the HMW DNA extraction from yeast using primarily the Temperature Module and Heater-Shaker Module. Here's how you can utilize these modules:

1. Temperature Module:
   - Use for DNA precipitation steps at 4°C
   - Can be used for any steps requiring temperature control between 4-95°C

2. Heater-Shaker Module:
   - Use for initial yeast culture growth and agitation
   - Can be used for incubation steps requiring both temperature control and agitation (e.g., cell wall digestion, lysis steps)

For the rest of the protocol, you don't necessarily need additional modules. The standard OT-2 deck and pipettes should be sufficient for the remaining liquid handling steps. However, there are a couple of considerations:

1. Magnetic Module: While not strictly necessary, it could be useful for DNA purification steps if you decide to use magnetic bead-based purification methods instead of centrifugation.

2. HEPA Module: Not required, but could be beneficial if you're concerned about contamination, especially during DNA elution steps.

Given the protocol's focus on gentle handling to preserve HMW DNA, the OT-2's precise liquid handling capabilities, combined with the Temperature Module for controlled cooling during precipitation, should be sufficient for most steps. The Heater-Shaker Module can handle the initial culture and any steps requiring agitation.

For steps involving gravity sedimentation or long incubations, you can simply use the OT-2 deck, programming appropriate wait times between steps.

In summary, with the Temperature Module and Heater-Shaker Module, along with the standard OT-2 capabilities, you should be able to perform the majority of the HMW DNA extraction protocol without needing additional modules.
