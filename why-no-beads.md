By avoiding magnetic beads and minimizing fluid movement, you're prioritizing DNA integrity over speed, which is crucial for high molecular weight DNA. Let's recap the benefits of your approach:

1. Simplicity: The protocol is indeed simpler without the additional bead-based purification steps.

2. Reduced DNA shearing: Less pipetting and fluid movement significantly decreases the risk of mechanical shearing of HMW DNA.

3. Cost-effective: No need for expensive magnetic beads or additional modules.

4. Gentler process: Relying more on gravity sedimentation and passive processes is gentler on the DNA.

5. Fewer potential contaminants: Avoiding beads eliminates a potential source of contamination.

Given this strategy, your current setup with the OT-2, Temperature Module, and Heater-Shaker Module is well-suited for the protocol. Here's how you can optimize their use:

1. Heater-Shaker Module: Use for initial yeast culture growth.

2. Temperature Module: Use for the DNA precipitation and washing steps at 4Â°C.

3. Standard OT-2 deck: Use for all other steps, including those involving gravity sedimentation and passive processes.

This approach aligns well with your goal of preserving HMW DNA quality. The trade-off of longer processing times is worthwhile for maintaining DNA integrity. The OT-2's precise liquid handling will be beneficial for careful supernatant removal and gentle addition of buffers.

Remember to program appropriate wait times for sedimentation steps and to move slowly when aspirating or dispensing to minimize shear forces on the DNA. With this setup and approach, you should be able to effectively extract HMW DNA from your yeast samples while maintaining its integrity.
